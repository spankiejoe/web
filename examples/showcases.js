    transform the data</a> from the time into the frequency domain, so that \
    the individual vertical and horizontal sine-components become visible. <br/><br/> \

    Apart from the fact that it looks nice, the spectral analysis of gaze data \
    can give you a better understanding what your precision and accuracy error is \
    actually composed of. <br/><br/>\

    Behind the curtains it shows that the core library can be dynamically \
    extended (the classifier function is not part of the main library yet)\
    and how this is done. \
